# Calculating Matrice Intermediare (direct food security data)

After survey teams have processed the data (cleaned, calculated indicators and added survey weights), then the R syntax below can be used to generate a .csv file of the Food Security Direct evidence that can be pasted into the matrice intermediare

## Generating Matrice Intermediare

### Example processed data set

Here is the example processed data set:

### Syntax

Here is the syntax to generate the matrice intermediare from processed dataset:

## Troubleshooting & Known issues

- If the country did not collect all the 5 Food Security Indicators (FCS, HDDS, rCSI, HHS, LhCS) - the modules not collected should be removed from the code 
- If the level of analysis is at the Admin 1 level only - then the variables ADMIN2Name and ADMIN2Code should be removed from the code
- If the ADMIN1Name and ADMIN2Name were not collected with geocodes (see Chapter 2) then the code will have to be modified
